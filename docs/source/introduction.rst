* Library functions
* Guide to extending the library

Higher level functions show how we can apply TECHNIQUES to image data, while
the API and core functions


High level (helper scripts)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The high level scripts can get you started with some standard deep learning
tasks (training or retraining convolutional networks on image data) very fast.



Medium (API functions)
