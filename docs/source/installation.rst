Installation
------------

dtoolAI requires Python version 3 and Pytorch.

.. warning:: Install Pytorch before installing dtoolAI. For information on how to install Pytorch this see the
             `Pytorch getting started guide <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_
             for details.

You can install dtoolAI via the pip package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dtoolai

To understand the examples, it's also useful to install the dtool command line
client. This makes it easier to see what metadata are being written when we use
dtoolAI:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dtool-cli

Running the example notebooks in the code repository also requires Jupyter:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install jupyter

Finally, if you want to run the test suite in the code repository, you'll need
pytest.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install pytest
