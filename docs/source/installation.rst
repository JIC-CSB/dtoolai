Installation
------------

You can install dtoolAI via the pip package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dtoolAI

To understand the examples, it's also useful to install the dtool command line
client. This makes it easier to see what metadata are being written when we use
dtoolAI.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dtool-cli
