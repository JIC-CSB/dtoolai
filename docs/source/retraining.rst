Retraining a model
------------------

Let's look at how to do this. First, we'll collect some data. For this example,

In this example, we'll take a pre-trained ResNet (REF) model, and retrain the
model on our 

Gathering data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Converting the data into a DataSet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dtoolAI provides a helper script to convert a set of named directories
containing images into a the form of dataset suitable for training a deep
learning model.

Retraining the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we can run the retraining process

* The input dataset
* 

Applying the retrained model to new images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we can test the newly trained model.
